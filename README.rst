One place for our beautiful simple yet complex articles to share knowledge on setting up servers, maintaining, development environments, concepts, snippets etc.


Questions, Comments, etc?
-------------------------

Our hope is that microurl is so simple that you'd never *have* to ask any questions, but if you feel the need to contact us for this (or other) reasons, you can hit us up at micropyramid@googlegroups.com.


Want to help?
-------------

microurl is useful, but ultimately only as useful as the people using it (say that ten times fast!). If you'd like to help, write example code, contribute patches, document things on the wiki, tweet about it. Your help is always appreciated!
